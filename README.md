# CUT LINK
Application for cutting links.


# Warning!
Add folders 'static_cdn', 'media_cdn' in the same directory as 'static'
folders and call collectstatic command.
More correctly to place that folders one step outer (you can specify it in
settings). But we don't want to manage our static files from another host
and this way was made only for example.
